							<img class="img-responsive" src = "image/2005.png" /><br />
							<h4><b>Theme:</b><h4><br />
							<p style ="font-size:15px;">
							The theme of the competition was to shoot down the opponents pins by tennis balls within the
								defined time limit (or in the shortest possible time). Each team consisted of an instructor, three
								playing members and a desired member of the pit crew. There would be one manual robot
								necessarily and one (or optionally more) automated machines. The manual machine and the
								automated machines all had to fit within the size limits of 50cm x 50cm x 75cm and 40cm x
								40cm x 40cm respectively. Moreover the whole equipment could not exceed 35 kg.
								The manual machine of each team would be provided with 7 green balls whereas the
								automated machine would be provided with 11 red tennis balls with which they had to topple
								down as many of the opponents’ pins as possible within the period of 3 minutes. One would be
								the blue team with blue pins and the other would be the red team possessing red pins. The pins
								were 45 cm tall each and 11 in number for each team.<br />
								The automated machines of both the teams were supposed to follow the green belts, while the
								manual were to be guided through the red and blue belts drawn respectively on the either sides
								of the pin-zone. Both the automated and the manual machines had to target the countercolored
								pins that stood on the opposition’s side and each toppling of those pins would earn
								them 10 points. In addition to that, a special golden pin was also placed in the center that
								would help them score an alluring 25. However, if any side toppled their own pins, each pin
								would cost them 10 points. Similar deduction would occur if the robots crossed their zones or
								toppled the opponent’s pins through physical contact.<br />
								A team would automatically win if any one of its robots toppled down all of the opponent’s pins
								first before the time completed. If not, the winner would be decided based on the points
								achieved in 3 minutes.<br />
								15 teams that participated in the contest were divided into 5 groups of three each and the
								teams of each group would compete with the two others in round robin format. Along with the
								5 group winners, 3 top scoring teams from the pool of rest 10 teams would advance to the
								knockout stage (quarter final).

							<img class="img-responsive" src = "image/2006.png" /><br />
							<h4><b>Theme:</b><h4><br />
							<p style ="font-size:15px;">
							The theme of the contest was ‘Mission Everest’ and as the theme suggested, the objective
							was to simulate the climbing of Mount Everest and reaching its summit by a group of robots
							while transporting supplies to the camp and more notably, cleaning the trail up the summit.
							Each team would have to make one manual and one (or optionally more) automated robots.
							The manual robot had to fit in the dimensions 1.5m x 1m x 0.8m whereas each of the
							automated robots had to be within the size 75m x 75m x 75m. The total weight of the
							equipment couldn’t exceed 50 kg. Each team could have 3 students, 1 instructor and an
							optional technical assistant.<br/>
							The game field was of dimensions 10m x 9m and five transparent cylindrical baskets were kept
							in the area depicting the base camp. The rubbish and trash were substituted by tin or plastic
							jars. Similarly, the provisions were symbolized by balls. The manual robot had to collect the
							waste materials and dump them in the dump zone while the automated machine had to put
							their team’s balls in at least 5 transparent cylinders placed in the game field and were also 
							assigned to put the teams’ flag in the summit zone. The manual and automated robots move in
							their specified zones only.<br/>
							Each waste collection would fetch 2 points while putting the balls in the outside and inside
							cylinders would get them 5 points and 10 points respectively. Finally, the first team to put the
							flag in the summit zone would get 20 points and the second one would get 15 points. If a team
							succeeded in dropping at least 3 balls in 3 collinear cylinders, dumping at least one waste in
							dumping zone and putting the flag at the summit before 3 minutes ended, the team would be
							the ‘Everest Conqueror’ and automatically win that game.<br/>
							The contest would be played by dividing the teams into groups and making the teams of each
							group compete in round robin league format, based on which the eight excelling teams would
							advance to the knockout stage.</p>

							<img class="img-responsive" src = "image/2010.png" /><br />
							<h4><b>Theme:</b><h4><br />
							<p style ="font-size:15px;">
							The theme of Robocup 2010 was “Working together for better Nepal”. The slogan was chosen to
							promote a strong sense of helpfulness and co-operation among people, to make Nepal better and to
							fortify the feeling of unity, fair play and fair competition among the technical students of our country.
							The game consisted of a pre-designed game field. There were white stripes on the green background
							which guided the robots to find their path. Each team made two robots, one manual operated by the
							operator and another automatic consisting of a chip and sensors which would lead the robot along the
							white stripes.<br /><br />
							The robots were the symbols of “driver of the nation”, working together to complete a set of tasks to
							build a prosperous nation. The automatic robot received a “token of success” from manual robot and
							climbed up and downhill while the manual robot bridged the “broken trail”. On its way, the automatic
							robot gives the three scoring balls, representing child, youth and elderly people of the society, to the
							manual robots. The manual robot then would take the three scoring balls to the “prosperous society”.
							The game would complete once the automatic robot scored the “token of success” on the “chest of
							glory”.<br /><br />

							<h3><b>7. IOE Robocon 2016</b></h3><br />
							<img class="img-responsive" src = "image/2016.png" /><br />
							<h4><b>Theme:</b><h4><br />
							<p style ="font-size:15px;">
							Our country Nepal has the most varying geographical terrains in the whole
							world. The terrains vary from flat belts to mid hills to very steep mountain
							ranges. Despite the awkward and astonishing terrains, people reside in flat belts
							as well as near steep mountains. Although the lifestyle of people in southern flat
							regions has significantly improved, there still exists hardship in the hilly and
							mountain regions. People still transport consumable and non-consumable goods
							from Terai region to Hills and Mountains for sustaining their lives. People face
							various obstacles like flood, landslides, etc. during the transport.<br />
							Based on the facts above, the game of IOE Robocon 2016 is designed in order
							to visualize the geographical terrains of our country and transport of various
							items from flat belts to high mountains. Each team has to build one robot. The
							robot picks two payloads from flat belt. One is common consumable good (salt)
							and other is a telecommunication device. Crossing the different terrains and
							removing the various obstacles, the telecommunication device is dropped off at
							Pokhara and the consumable good is dropped off at Mustang. So, the theme of
							the contest “Journey to Mustang”. <br /><br />
							
							A match is contested by Red and Blue teams. It lasts 3 minutes at most.
							Each team consists of one robot. Robots start from Robot Start Zone and pick
							up the payloads from the Vandar. Then the robots run along three zones; Terai,
							Hills, Mountains, and aim for Mustang.<br />
							Robot starts from the Robot Start Zone and picks up two payloads, a
							telecommunication device and salt from the Vandar. Then it climbs the Hill
							and reaches the Valley where it drops the first payload i.e. the
							telecommunication device at Pokhara. Clearing the obstacles from its path, the
							robot aims towards Mountain. With the help of Tuin, robot moves from Tarr
							to Mustang. The robot drops the second payload i.e. salt at Mustang. The team
							that successfully delivers payloads earlier is the winner of the game. This type
							of winning is called “Sahi-Ho”. <br />
